Project Portfolio for Data Structures and Algorithms class
This program essentially takes input data and stores the data Object into three different stacks. There is the original queue, a queue sorted by name (descending order), and a queue sorted by the order number (descending order). The queues are sorted by a quick sort algorithm utilizing a comparator. The user has the option to input data, remove data from the top of the queue and display the original queue.
